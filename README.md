Project a i m s:

The SunbYte III (Sheffield University Nova Balloon Lifted Telescope III) project aimed to create a solar telescope which can be lifted by balloon to an altitude of $\sim 40 km$ and operate autonomously to take high quality pictures of the Sun in the Hydrogen-Alpha spectral line ( 656.28 nm ). This is a University of Sheffield extracurricular student led project. The students of this years SunbYte III team have worked extremely hard to design and create their payload, and the project has been accepted to NASA's High Altitude Student Platform launch in September 2019 (Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA).
