Project a i m s:

The OzyByte I (Monash University, Flinders University and Sheffield University) project aimed to create a solar telescope which can be lifted by balloon to an altitude of ~ 40 km and operate autonomously to take high quality pictures of the Sun in the Hydrogen-Alpha spectral line ( 656.28 nm ). This is a Monash University in collaboration with  Sheffield University extracurricular student led project. The students will  design and create their payload, and the project will seek approval to be launched by  NASA's High Altitude Student Platform (Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA) or similar.

OzyByte I is an interdisciplinary project, with students from across several STEM degree programs: Science, Engineering, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering,  Systems Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science. Each of the students will be active member and  able to apply knowledge from their own degree subjects, but will also be able to learn new skills such a CAD, programming in C or Python, using laser / water jet cutters and 3D printers. This is also a unique opportunity for students that are not in their final year to take part in a large and relatively long term group projects.
