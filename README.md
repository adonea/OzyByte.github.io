Project aims:

Ozybyte is a Monash cross-faculty project aimed at developing a low-cost, high-impact experiment for solar imaging. The OzyByte will introduces an affordable and innovative experiment for  solar observation by aiming to  lift a Monash telescope into the stratosphere using a high-altitude balloon. This method bridges the gap between expensive space missions and limited ground-based telescopes, while providing valuable educational and research opportunities for Monash students and researchers.

Problem Statement:Ground-based solar telescopes suffer from image distortion due to the Earth’s atmosphere, requiring expensive adaptive optics systems. While space telescopes avoid these issues, they are extremely costly to launch and cannot be easily repaired or upgraded. 
OurSolution:OzyByte addresses these challenges by deploying a balloon-based telescope that operates in the near-space environment. By using a weather balloon to carry a telescope to an altitude of approximately 35 km, we rise above most of the Earth’s atmosphere. This significantly reduces distortion and allows for much clearer solar images. To enhance image quality even further, OzyByte will use high frame-rate lucky imaging, a technique that selects the sharpest frames from rapid sequences of images. This increases the chances of capturing scientifically valuable data without the high costs of space missions.


The OzyByte I will be a collaboration between Monash University, Flinders University and Sheffield University, a  project aimed to create a solar telescope. It is an extracurricular student led project. The students will  design and create their payload, and the project will seek approval to be launched by  NASA's High Altitude Student Platform (Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA) or similar.

OzyByte I welcomes students across several STEM degree programs: Science, Engineering, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering,  Systems Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science. Each of the students will be active member and  able to apply knowledge from their own degree subjects, but will also be able to learn new skills such a CAD, programming in C or Python, using laser / water jet cutters and 3D printers. This is also a unique opportunity for students that are not in their final year to take part in a large and relatively long term group projects.
